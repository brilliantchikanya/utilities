At the core of streams is the concept of I/O - input and output

Data that exists inside files on a computer's filesystem is called persistent
data because it persists after programs run.

In Java programs, files are created through streams. A stream is a sequence of 
bytes - which can be an input stream or an output stream.

Streams are written to the filesystem to create files, and they can also be
transferred over the internet.
